# Music Recommendation with Spotipy
Music Recommendation Project using Spotipy for Data Mining and Text Analytics Unit

## Overview
This project centers around music recommendation utilizing Spotipy, a Python library for the Spotify API. It offers a seamless experience for users to discover new music based on their preferences.

Why Use Google Colab?
When working on this project, we recommend using Google Colab for the following reasons:

Seamless Collaboration: Google Colab allows multiple users to collaborate in real-time on the same Jupyter notebook. This is particularly useful for team projects where members may be working remotely.

Cloud-Based Execution: Colab provides free access to GPU resources, enabling faster execution of machine learning tasks. This can be advantageous when dealing with large datasets or complex algorithms.

Integrated Environment: Colab comes pre-installed with many popular Python libraries, including Spotipy. This eliminates the need for manual installations and ensures a consistent environment across collaborators.

Easy Sharing: Colab notebooks can be easily shared with others, facilitating code review and collaboration. Additionally, Colab integrates seamlessly with Google Drive, allowing for easy storage and sharing of project files.

However, if your workflow is more comfortable with Visual Studio Code, you can still adapt the provided code to your preferred environment.

## Setting Up Spotify API Access
Spotipy is a Python client for the Spotify Web API, facilitating data fetching and catalog querying. Follow these steps to set up your Spotify API access:

Install Spotipy using the following command:

bash
Copy code
!pip install spotipy
Create a Spotify Developer's account and log in.

Navigate to the Spotify Developer Dashboard.

Click on "Create an App" and fill in the required information to register your app.

After creating the app, you will be provided with a Client ID and secret key. Save these as they will be needed to authenticate your Spotipy requests.

By following these steps, you ensure that your Spotipy library is correctly set up and authenticated to access the Spotify API for seamless music recommendation.
